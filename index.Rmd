# Welcome

Hi! Welcome to my website for MATH230 Final Project. On the top right corner you will find links to my past visualizations created in MATH230 and two data story pages -- one for the story itself and another for all the code that built the visualizations used in my data story.

My data story explores the relationships about used car listings in the United States. I found a dataset on the music with mental health. Hope you will like my visualizations!
