# Past Course Visualizations

## Generative Art

The pictures below are artworks generated using the `aRtsy` [package](https://github.com/koenderks/aRtsy), which uses some algorithms with certain parameter and randomization settings to generate beautiful pieces autonomously.

## Plots from ggplot extension project

### ggplot extensions -- ggridges

Note that the ggridges function here means that the density ridgeline plot [ggridges package] is an alternative to the standard geom_density() [ggplot2 R package] function that can be useful for visualizing changes in distributions, of a continuous variable, over time or space.

### Here we are going to see the plots that using ggplot exntesions--ggridges that we learned during the semester.

Description: 

In this analysis, we're exploring the captivating `ForestFires` dataset from the `Lock5Data` package in RStudio. This dataset offers insights into the characteristics of forest fires in the picturesque Montesinho park in Portugal. You can find more information about this dataset in the Package ‘Lock5Data’ document available at: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Lock5Data/Lock5Data.pdf.

We've chosen to utilize the visually striking geom_density_ridges function, which expertly computes density estimates from the data and showcases them through an elegant ridgeline visualization.

Our x-axis represents the Duff Moisture Code (DMC), a crucial measure of fuel moisture within decomposed organic material beneath the forest floor's litter. Meanwhile, the y-axis denotes the day of the week, ranging from Sunday to Saturday.

A glance at our beautifully crafted plot reveals that the distribution of the DMC is approximately symmetric for each day of the week, with similar spread and median values. To enhance the visual appeal of our plot, we've added artistic elements by transforming each point into a unique shape and filling the area beneath the curve with a distinct color that corresponds to the specific day.

## Confidence Interval Plots & Interactive Shiny Visualizations

This embedded shinny app here are meant to teach the Stats I (Math 216) students about the basic idea for the confidence leve. To be more specific, in this interactive Shiny app, we provide a creative way for introductory statistics students to 
understand confidence levels through data simulation and visualization with coverage of

• repeated sampling

• effect of different confidence levels on interval width

• effect of different confidence levels on interval accuracy

## Past Course Visualization during the semester

### Relationship between high MSRP and Drive Type

![](past_1.png){width="100%"}

#### Description: 

We can observe that for vehicles with high MSRPs and an AWD drivetrain, the price range spans from a minimum of 22,040 dollars to a maximum of 164,400 dollars, with a first quantile of 38,830 dollars, a median of 49,480 dollars, a mean of 57,180 dollars, and a third quantile of 68,690 dollars.

In the case of vehicles with high MSRPs and an FWD drivetrain, the prices range from a minimum of 16,090 dollars to a maximum of 47,320 dollars, with a first quantile of 22,890 dollars, a median of 27,950 dollars, a mean of 29,130 dollars, and a third quantile of 35,530 dollars.

For high MSRP vehicles featuring an RWD drivetrain, the price range extends from a minimum of 37,990 to a maximum of 125,400 dollars, with a first quantile of 63,700 dollars, a median of 68,000 dollars, a mean of 73,080 dollars, and a third quantile of 70,300 dollars.

Examining the captivating violin plot, it becomes evident that on average, FWD vehicles have the lowest high MSRP among all drivetrain types, while RWD vehicles boast the highest high MSRP on average. The plot also reveals that the spread of high MSRPs for FWD vehicles is the smallest among the three types, and the spread for AWD vehicles is the largest.

This information aligns with our expectations, as RWD vehicles are often associated with faster performance and sports car attributes, leading to higher prices. The extensive spread of high MSRPs for AWD vehicles can be attributed to their versatile design, catering to a broad audience with various needs, from standard sedans to luxury models.

### Students Coming in & Going out 

![](past_2.png){width="100%"}

#### Description: 


The enchanting plot titled "Student Coming in & Going out" elegantly illustrates the density of data points representing the Admission Rate and Completion Rate for schools in the CollegeData dataset. The x-axis gracefully displays the Admission Rate, while the y-axis showcases the Completion Rate.

It's worth noting that the color gradient on the sidebars, transitioning from blue to red, indicates increasing density. Observing the graph, we can deduce that a substantial proportion of the total sample consists of students with an admission rate of around 70% and a completion rate of around 60%.

Additionally, we can spot a few data points in the region where the admission rate ranges from 0-25% and the completion rate spans from 0-100%. These intriguing data points are somewhat removed from the main population, suggesting a lower admission rate but a higher completion rate.
